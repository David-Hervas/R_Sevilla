## Do you need this package?

If you don't ever save your workspace (i.e., you run all the code again from the start every time you load up your project), you **don't need** this package

If your workspace usually consists of few objects, you **probably don't need** this package

If your projects consist of saving and loading many objects from or into your workspace (potentially multiple times), **this package is for you!** Even more if these objects are large, or if multiple users work on the same project.
